The code provided for this project focused on setting up the environment, defining the neural network model, and providing utility functions for visualizing and testing the maze-solving process. The code that I provided impemented the core training logic for deep Q-learning, including experience replay, action selection (exploration vs. exploitation), model training, and performance tracking.

What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists are involved in the study, design, and development of algorithms and software to solve problems across various domains. Their work is necessary for advancing technology by driving innovations and improving efficiencies in countless fields.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first clearly defining the problem. After that, I follow a systematic approach that involves research, algorithm design, implementation, testing, deployment, and iteration.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?

Security and privacy are at the forefront of my ethical responsibilities to the end users. Protection against unauthorized access and breaches is paramount and should not be taken lightly. Other important responsibilities include transparency, non-discrimination, and sustainability for things like environmental impact.
